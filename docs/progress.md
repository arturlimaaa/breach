# Progress

## 2026-10-17, session 1

Shipped (M0, branch `al/m0-core`): typed rules with scope and status
(`rules.py`), store with server-scope shadowing (`store.py`), grid world with
seeded layouts, rulesets, and the probe action (`world.py`), minimum-action
planner over certified rules only (`planner.py`), transition log with exact
and tolerant verdicts (`log.py`), executor that aborts a plan at the first
exact mismatch (`loop.py`). 17 tests pass:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`

Gate M0: empty store issues zero crafts; a stick-count ruleset aborts at the
craft step with zero actions after; the same seed loads identically.

Dead ends: the planner's cost recursion returned a (cost, rule) tuple where a
number was expected; the executor reused a stale map after mining and mined
the same cell twice. Both fixed, both covered by the loop tests.

Not done: H2 exploration. The blind spiral is O(r²) and cannot reach logs 33
blocks away within 300 actions; the grid needs the ring-sample `look` (M3).
Persistence paths of the store and log are written but not exercised by tests.

Next session, first: M1 (verifier whitelist by action and block, `quarantined`
verdict, certifier by replay with the three conditions, server-scoped
demotion), tests first.

Operator queue: repo name and remote (nothing is pushed yet), Crusoe org and
credit form, build.nvidia.com key, Jev key for B, Minecraft EULA.
